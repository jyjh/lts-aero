classdef FrontWing < lts.components.Aero.AeroComponent
    % FRONTWING Front wing aerodynamic model
    % Positioned ahead of the front axle. Highly sensitive to pitch/ride height
    % because it operates in ground effect with a large pitch moment arm.
    %
    % Pitch behavior:
    %   - Nose UP (braking) → increased front ride height → less ground effect → LESS downforce
    %   - Nose DOWN (accel) → decreased front ride height → more ground effect → MORE downforce
    %   This is pitchSensitivityClA < 0 (negative: positive pitch reduces ClA)
    
    properties
        heightSensitivity    = 0.3 % Fractional ClA change per cm of height deviation
