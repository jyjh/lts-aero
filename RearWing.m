classdef RearWing < lts.components.Aero.AeroComponent
    % REARWING Rear wing aerodynamic model
    % Positioned behind the rear axle. Moderate pitch sensitivity.
    % Typically has the highest CdA of all components due to high angle of attack.
    %
    % Pitch behavior:
    %   - Nose UP (braking) → rear squats → rear gets closer to ground → MORE downforce
    %   - Nose DOWN (accel) → rear rises → less ground effect → LESS downforce
    %   This is pitchSensitivityClA > 0 (positive: positive pitch increases ClA)
    
    properties
        heightSensitivity    = 0.15 % Fractional ClA change per cm of height deviation
