classdef (Abstract) AeroComponent
    % AEROCOMPONENT Abstract interface for aerodynamic models
    % Each aero element has its own position, pitch sensitivity, and
    % computes forces based on full vehicle state (speed, pitch, ride height).
    %
    % Multiple AeroComponents are composed by AeroManager.
    
    properties
        name        = 'AeroComponent'  % Descriptive name
        xPosition   = 0    % Longitudinal position from CG [m], positive = forward
        zPosition   = 0    % Nominal height above ground [m]
        ClA         = 1.0  % Downforce coefficient * area [m^2]
        CdA         = 0.5  % Drag coefficient * area [m^2]
