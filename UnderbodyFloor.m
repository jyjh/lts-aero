classdef UnderbodyFloor < lts.components.Aero.AeroComponent
    % UNDERBODYFLOOR Floor / diffuser / underbody aerodynamic model
    % Positioned near the CG. VERY highly sensitive to ride height (ground effect).
    % The floor is the most ride-height-dependent aero device on an FSAE car.
    %
    % Pitch behavior:
    %   - Nose UP → floor leading edge rises → air escapes under splitter → LESS downforce
    %   - Nose DOWN → floor leading edge drops → stronger underbody seal → MORE downforce
    %   BUT also: too low = stall / porpoising
    %   Net effect: negative pitch sensitivity (loses DF on nose-up)
    %
    % Height behavior:
    %   Downforce increases as floor gets closer to ground, up to a stalling limit.
    %   Modeled as an exponential relationship.

    properties
        stallHeight          = 0.015 % Below this height, floor stalls [m]
        heightExponent       = 0.6   % Controls ground-effect sensitivity curve
